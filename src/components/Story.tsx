        Film is a remarkably effective medium in conveying drama and especially in the evocation of emotion. The art of
        motion pictures is exceedingly complex, requiring contributions from nearly all the other arts as well as
        countless technical skills (for example, in sound recording, photography, and optics). Emerging at the end of
        the 19th century, this new art form became one of the most popular and influential media of the 20th century and
        beyond.
